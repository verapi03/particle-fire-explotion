# particle-fire-explotion
The Particle Fire Explotion is a simulation program written in C++ using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and applying some of the basics of games programming techniques. 

Pixel manipulation is used to manage a bunch of virtual particles which appear on the screen, gradually change colour and move in a kind of circle around each other. Said motion is implemented by combining cartesian and polar coordinates in the particle swarm algorithm.

The blurry change of colors effect along the simulation is created through a box blur algorithm.

This program is the result of an exercise proposed by John Purcell from the Cave of Programming. The program was implemented using the GCC compiler (GNU Compiler Collection) and Eclipse IDE for C/C++.
